# KATA Problems

## Description

A few of Kata style problems to work through. Focus on talking through how you are solving the problem and why you are taking a certain approach.

### First Recurring Char

Given a string `ABCDEBA`, return the first recurring character.

### Fizz Buzz

Print integers 1 to N, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

### Is Sum in Both Arrays

Given two arrays and a target value of `48`:

```javascript
[40, 2, 35, 12, 54]
[19, 46, 8, 90, 4]
```

Return true or false if the target value can be created with any values from array 1 and array 2.

## Notes

* Talk us through what you’re doing and the decisions you’re making, it’s OK to think
  out loud.
* A focus on clean, testable code.
* Implement or highlight any optimisations you have identified.
* Write tests for your implementation.

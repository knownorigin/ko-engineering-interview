# JSON API Exercise

## Description

We heavily utilise 3rd party APIs, we would like you to load a list of user posts, with additional
user data in a performant and scalable manner.

## Exercise

Using the API below, load all user posts and then decorate them with the appropriate user
data.

1. Retrieve post data API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
   * GET a list of users posts

2. Retrieve user data API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/{userId}
   * GET a specific users data

3. Once you have these, combine the data!

4. Group the data you have fetched by the user ID

5. If you've got this far then implement some tests

Write an implementation for the above with some test coverage.

## Notes

Things we're looking for:

* Talk us through what you’re doing and the decisions you’re making, it’s OK to think
out loud.
* A focus on clean, testable code.
* Implement or highlight any optimisations you have identified.
* Write tests for your implementation.
